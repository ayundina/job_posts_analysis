We are joined on this mission by 49,000 partner sellers that do business on our retail tech platform. This represents a combined assortment of approximately 41 million articles and peak sales of 1,800 orders per minute.\\n\\nIn order to process these sales, our logistics operation has grown tremendously over the past years, currently shipping roughly 500,000 items per day from one of our 5 gigantic warehouses. Because of the enormous complexity of the bol.com logistics landscape, data science and operations research are playing a crucial role in ensuring that we make optimal use of our resources and deliver every parcel on time in a cost-effective manner. This ranges from solving shortest path problems in the warehouses to ensure efficient order picking under tight time constraints, to real-time load-balancing the orders across... the warehouses to avoid bottlenecks and formulating and solving massive integer programming problems that determine where we place our stock.\\n\\nIn this role, you make an impactful contribution to that goal by developing clever algorithms that enable us to deploy logistical resources within our warehouses rationally. Making sure that every item is processed efficiently and leaves the warehouse on time.\\n\\nThe biggest challenge\\n\\nWe need to safeguard that our retail organization and sales partners deliver on our ambitious logistics promises. Given our enormous growth over the past years in order volume and the increasing complexity of the logistics landscape – e.g., we offer logistics as a service – designing and implementing smart algorithms is the logical next step. How can we fully utilize logistical resources cost-efficiently? How can we ensure stock is where it should be? And how can we fulfill wildly varying customer orders in the best possible way?\\n\\nWhat you do as Senior Data Scientist Operations Research\\n\\nIn this position you join a forward-thinking, multi-disciplinary team of data scientists, software engineers and business analysts and help them develop an in-depth understanding of intricate logistical processes. This includes identifying (potential) bottlenecks. Translate your findings into data-driven optimization and simulation models. And continuously adjust and improve the models as new challenges arise.\\n\\nThe fluid nature of bol.com – change is the only constant – and the extremely data-rich environment make for an interesting playing field. The challenges we face are both incredibly complex and, when solved, vastly rewarding. You mainly work on scalable, long-term solutions, but when (potential) issues arise you’ll need to think on your feet to quickly get to the core problems and make the appropriate decisions. Often going on limited and/or unvalidated information. By virtue of your pragmatic approach and by leveraging the deep knowledge of our algorithms, you manage to strike the right balance between battling complexity and achieving working results. You’ll build solutions from the ground up with the software engineers in your team and assume full ownership of your solutions. Keeping these solutions (and yourself) responsive during peak hours is key.\\n• Leverage logistical insights to develop optimization models, simulation models and smart heuristics for the processes across our logistics\\n• Tweak and improve those models on a challenge-by-challenge basis\\n• Strike the right balance between ‘battling complexity’ and achieving concrete results\\n• Team up with engineers to build and implement new or improved solutions\\n• Check in regularly with your colleagues from operations for feedback on your solutions and to identify problems and potential improvements\\n• Ensure solutions are robust and responsive, even/especially during peak hours\\n\\nWhy you can make a difference\\n\\nTo be successful as Senior Data Scientist Operations Research, you’ll need solid experience in optimization and simulation, as well as programming skills in Python and optionally experience with Java or (an)other relevant language(s). Because you’ll work closely with colleagues in different domains and with a wide variety of skill sets and backgrounds, you also need to be open to approaching issues from different perspectives. This way of working often yields the clearest insights and the best results. And as our environment is constantly changing, we expect our data scientists to be eager to learn, both by honing their existing skills and by venturing into new territory.\\n\\n3 reasons why this is (not) for you\\n\\nPros\\n• You breathe optimization\\nYou bring 5+ years of experience in operations research, econometrics, or a related field\\n• You are a self-starter\\nYou love to experiment and innovate and can get colleagues on board for the ride\\n• You go from concept to realisation\\nYou enjoy translating complex questions to the technical implementation of scalable models and heuristics\\n\\nCons\\n• You’re not into optimizing for usefulness’\\nYou’d rather use the latest techniques to optimize for coolness, than the right tools to optimize for usefulness\\n• You’re not into engineering\\nYou’ve never worked with software engineers and don’t look forward to the experience. BigQuery and Python are terra incognita\\n• You don’t like experimentation\\nYou think your solutions are invariably 100% perfect, right from the moment of inception\\n\\nThis is where you’ll work\\n\\nAt the premier online retail tech platform in the Netherlands and Belgium. A platform where 13 million Dutch and Belgian customers can choose from over 47 million articles. A platform that helps roughly 50,000 commercial partners run their business. And a platform that will never be ‘finished’, because bol.com has been reinventing retail since 1999 and we always will be. If there’s a better way to do something, we’re working on it! Together with our customers, partners, and about 3,000 colleagues.

We are joined on this mission by 49,000 partner sellers that do business on our retail tech platform. This represents a combined assortment of approximately 41 million articles and peak sales of 1,800 orders per minute.\\n\\nIn order to process these sales, our logistics operation has grown tremendously over the past years, currently shipping roughly 500,000 items per day from one of our 5 gigantic warehouses. Because of the enormous complexity of the bol.com logistics landscape, data science and operations research are playing a crucial role in ensuring that we make optimal use of our resources and deliver every parcel on time in a cost-effective manner. This ranges from solving shortest path problems in the warehouses to ensure efficient order picking under tight time constraints, to real-time load-balancing the orders across... the warehouses to avoid bottlenecks and formulating and solving massive integer programming problems that determine where we place our stock.\\n\\nIn this role, you make an impactful contribution to that goal by developing clever algorithms that enable us to deploy logistical resources within our warehouses rationally. Making sure that every item is processed efficiently and leaves the warehouse on time.\\n\\nThe biggest challenge\\n\\nWe need to safeguard that our retail organization and sales partners deliver on our ambitious logistics promises. Given our enormous growth over the past years in order volume and the increasing complexity of the logistics landscape – e.g., we offer logistics as a service – designing and implementing smart algorithms is the logical next step. How can we fully utilize logistical resources cost-efficiently? How can we ensure stock is where it should be? And how can we fulfill wildly varying customer orders in the best possible way?\\n\\nWhat you do as Senior Data Scientist Operations Research\\n\\nIn this position you join a forward-thinking, multi-disciplinary team of data scientists, software engineers and business analysts and help them develop an in-depth understanding of intricate logistical processes. This includes identifying (potential) bottlenecks. Translate your findings into data-driven optimization and simulation models. And continuously adjust and improve the models as new challenges arise.\\n\\nThe fluid nature of bol.com – change is the only constant – and the extremely data-rich environment make for an interesting playing field. The challenges we face are both incredibly complex and, when solved, vastly rewarding. You mainly work on scalable, long-term solutions, but when (potential) issues arise you’ll need to think on your feet to quickly get to the core problems and make the appropriate decisions. Often going on limited and/or unvalidated information. By virtue of your pragmatic approach and by leveraging the deep knowledge of our algorithms, you manage to strike the right balance between battling complexity and achieving working results. You’ll build solutions from the ground up with the software engineers in your team and assume full ownership of your solutions. Keeping these solutions (and yourself) responsive during peak hours is key.\\n• Leverage logistical insights to develop optimization models, simulation models and smart heuristics for the processes across our logistics\\n• Tweak and improve those models on a challenge-by-challenge basis\\n• Strike the right balance between ‘battling complexity’ and achieving concrete results\\n• Team up with engineers to build and implement new or improved solutions\\n• Check in regularly with your colleagues from operations for feedback on your solutions and to identify problems and potential improvements\\n• Ensure solutions are robust and responsive, even/especially during peak hours\\n\\nWhy you can make a difference\\n\\nTo be successful as Senior Data Scientist Operations Research, you’ll need solid experience in optimization and simulation, as well as programming skills in Python and optionally experience with Java or (an)other relevant language(s). Because you’ll work closely with colleagues in different domains and with a wide variety of skill sets and backgrounds, you also need to be open to approaching issues from different perspectives. This way of working often yields the clearest insights and the best results. And as our environment is constantly changing, we expect our data scientists to be eager to learn, both by honing their existing skills and by venturing into new territory.\\n\\n3 reasons why this is (not) for you\\n\\nPros\\n• You breathe optimization\\nYou bring 5+ years of experience in operations research, econometrics, or a related field\\n• You are a self-starter\\nYou love to experiment and innovate and can get colleagues on board for the ride\\n• You go from concept to realisation\\nYou enjoy translating complex questions to the technical implementation of scalable models and heuristics\\n\\nCons\\n• You’re not into optimizing for usefulness’\\nYou’d rather use the latest techniques to optimize for coolness, than the right tools to optimize for usefulness\\n• You’re not into engineering\\nYou’ve never worked with software engineers and don’t look forward to the experience. BigQuery and Python are terra incognita\\n• You don’t like experimentation\\nYou think your solutions are invariably 100% perfect, right from the moment of inception\\n\\nThis is where you’ll work\\n\\nAt the premier online retail tech platform in the Netherlands and Belgium. A platform where 13 million Dutch and Belgian customers can choose from over 47 million articles. A platform that helps roughly 50,000 commercial partners run their business. And a platform that will never be ‘finished’, because bol.com has been reinventing retail since 1999 and we always will be. If there’s a better way to do something, we’re working on it!

It moves with the speed of 10cm per second, but it doesn't know where to go, therefore every second it moves randomly 10cm directly north, south, east or west with equal probability.\\n• If the food is located on east-west lines 20cm to the north and 20cm to the south, as well as on north-south lines 20cm to the east and 20cm to the west from the anthill, how long will it take the ant to reach it on average?\\n• What is the average time the ant will reach food if it is located only on a diagonal line passing through (10cm, 0cm) and (0cm, 10cm) points?\\n• Can you write a program that comes up with an estimate of average time to find food for any closed boundary around the anthill? What would be the answer if food is located outside an defined by ( (x – 2.5cm) / 30cm )2 + ( (y – 2.5cm) / 40cm )2 < 1 in coordinate system where the anthill is located at (x = 0cm, y = 0cm)?

And do you have a PhD in the area of data science, preferably with knowledge of biomaterials? Then you are the person we are looking for! We offer a challenging job within a dynamic and very ambitious program, where good data management is a priority of each of the partners. Next to data management, you will actively participate in data-driven science projects that investigates the correlation between biomaterial properties and cell and tissue response.\\n\\nAbout MDR\\n\\nThe Research Center for Materials-Driven Regeneration (MDR) is a partnership between Eindhoven University of Technology, Maastricht University and Utrecht University, University Medical Center Utrecht and the Hubrecht Institute. This consortium was brought together to advance tissue and organ regeneration approaches with the use of instructive biomaterials. The MDR Research Center was awarded a 19 M€ grant in May 2017 by the ministry of education, culture and science... of the Netherlands in the framework of the Gravitation program.\\n\\nIn this 10-year program the interdisciplinary team of researchers within the MDR consortium aims to focus on the research and development of new, intelligent materials that stimulate the regeneration of damaged or diseased tissues and organs. Three research flagships are defined according to hierarchical levels of increasing length scale and structural complexity.\\n\\nIn order to strengthen our research center, we are looking forward to meeting highly motivated and talented people that would like to contribute in the interesting yet complex multidisciplinary area of Materials-Driven Regeneration.\\n\\nAbout the position\\n\\nData science plays a key role in successful scientific research and cooperation.

As a team you are responsible for building the infrastructure, implementing the algorithms and converting them to production ready models. Additionally, you will be part of a larger, cross-functional and dynamic team consisting of developers, designers, medical consultants and data engineers.\\n\\nMedical data is an interesting problem space, both in complexity and in societal value. The texts are a domain of its own with extremely high information density. It gives a real kick when users let us know they were... able to collect data that they were unable to collect without CTcue, such as finding people with a rare disease that might take years otherwise to diagnose or rapidly building quality datasets for COVID research.\\n\\nKey responsibilities:\\n• Mature and improve our CI/CD tools and components, and maintain CI/CD pipelines across multiple environments\\n• Python code optimization, containerization, deployment, versioning, and monitoring of its quality\\n• Data science models testing, validation and tests automation\\n• Develop and deploy scalable tools and services on our sites to handle machine learning training and inference\\n• Identify and evaluate new technologies to improve performance, maintainability, and reliability of our deployed machine learning systems\\n• Design and implement future cloud solutions, build MLOps on cloud (Azure)\\n• Apply software engineering rigor and best practices to machine learning, including CI/CD, automation, etc.\\n\\nYour profile\\n\\nYou are a professional who is passionate about improving healthcare and having a real impact. A background in Machine Learning is nice to have, but we will also value DevOps experience and a solid interest in AI. You have an appetite to learn and to develop yourself, an innate curiosity, and you can bring to light clarity around abstract and unclear problems. You feel comfortable working in a self-organising company where there is little hierarchy. You feel at home in maturing our ML ops solution and helping you fellow data scientist create better products.\\n\\nWhat we’re looking for:\\n• Bachelor's degree in Computer Science or Software Engineering\\n• Substantial experience in Python\\n• Ability to understand tools used by data scientist and experience with software development and test automation\\n• Ability to design and implement scalable solutions and ability to build MLOps pipelines on (cloud) solutions\\n• Experience with MLOps Frameworks like Kubeflow, MLFlow, DVC/CML, etc., experience with CUDA, Docker and Kubernetes\\n• Strong software engineering skills (Python), good understanding of Linux, knowledge of Deep Learning frameworks (such as PyTorch, Tensorflow, etc.)\\n• Experience in using MS Azure (preferred) or GCP, AWS services\\n\\nThe team\\n\\nToday we are used to having most information - anywhere in the world - right at our fingertips. It may therefore surprise you that this is not the case at all for the hospital world. When we (CTcue department) started building the Patient Finder search engine, we thought we could build a simple application that could automatically identify patients for clinical trials. However, in the process of developing this, we have gradually come to see that we are building something much more fundamental.\\n\\nThe problem in hospitals is that the data in the Electronic Health Record (EHR) is not suitable for performing automated analyses. About 70% of the data consists of text (unstructured data), and standard BI tools cannot handle that well. The result is that in practice manual searches are still the default.\\n\\nWe have developed a data platform in which the unstructured data is organized using machine learning / NLP and then stored together with the structured data from the EHR. The platform contains two innovative applications with which the EHR data can be searched and collected.\\n\\nOur aim has always been to support doctors in their work using data technology and it is with this in mind that we continue to develop and expand our platform. It goes without saying that privacy legislation forms a guideline in this. Our search engine is currently used daily in more than 40 hospitals in the Netherlands and Belgium. Our ambition is to expand the footprint of our platform to other key care and research hospitals across EMEA over the next few years.\\n\\nThose who join us become part of a recognized global leader still willing to challenge the status quo to improve patient care. In this business unit, you will have access to the most cutting-edge technology, the largest data sets, the best analytics tools and, in our opinion, some of the finest minds in the Healthcare industry.\\n\\nWe thank all applicants for their interest; however only those selected for interview will be contacted.\\n\\nIQVIA is a strong advocate of diversity and inclusion in the workplace. We believe that a work environment that embraces diversity will give us a competitive advantage in the global marketplace and enhance our success. We believe that an inclusive and respectful workplace culture fosters a sense of belonging among our employees, builds a stronger team, and allows individual employees the opportunity to maximize their personal potential\\n\\nIQVIA is a leading global provider of advanced analytics, technology solutions and clinical research services to the life sciences industry. We believe in pushing the boundaries of human science and data science to make the biggest impact possible – to help our customers create a healthier world.

It gives a real kick when users let us know they were... able to collect data that they were unable to collect without CTcue, such as finding people with a rare disease that might take years otherwise to diagnose or rapidly building quality datasets for COVID research.\\n\\nKey responsibilities:\\n• Mature and improve our CI/CD tools and components, and maintain CI/CD pipelines across multiple environments\\n• Python code optimization, containerization, deployment, versioning, and monitoring of its quality\\n• Data science models testing, validation and tests automation\\n• Develop and deploy scalable tools and services on our sites to handle machine learning training and inference\\n• Identify and evaluate new technologies to improve performance, maintainability, and reliability of our deployed machine learning systems\\n• Design and implement future cloud solutions, build MLOps on cloud (Azure)\\n• Apply software engineering rigor and best practices to machine learning, including CI/CD, automation, etc.\\n\\nYour profile\\n\\nYou are a professional who is passionate about improving healthcare and having a real impact. A background in Machine Learning is nice to have, but we will also value DevOps experience and a solid interest in AI. You have an appetite to learn and to develop yourself, an innate curiosity, and you can bring to light clarity around abstract and unclear problems. You feel comfortable working in a self-organising company where there is little hierarchy. You feel at home in maturing our ML ops solution and helping you fellow data scientist create better products.\\n\\nWhat we’re looking for:\\n• Bachelor's degree in Computer Science or Software Engineering\\n• Substantial experience in Python\\n• Ability to understand tools used by data scientist and experience with software development and test automation\\n• Ability to design and implement scalable solutions and ability to build MLOps pipelines on (cloud) solutions\\n• Experience with MLOps Frameworks like Kubeflow, MLFlow, DVC/CML, etc., experience with CUDA, Docker and Kubernetes\\n• Strong software engineering skills (Python), good understanding of Linux, knowledge of Deep Learning frameworks (such as PyTorch, Tensorflow, etc.)\\n• Experience in using MS Azure (preferred) or GCP, AWS services\\n\\nThe team\\n\\nToday we are used to having most information - anywhere in the world - right at our fingertips. It may therefore surprise you that this is not the case at all for the hospital world. When we (CTcue department) started building the Patient Finder search engine, we thought we could build a simple application that could automatically identify patients for clinical trials. However, in the process of developing this, we have gradually come to see that we are building something much more fundamental.\\n\\nThe problem in hospitals is that the data in the Electronic Health Record (EHR) is not suitable for performing automated analyses. About 70% of the data consists of text (unstructured data), and standard BI tools cannot handle that well. The result is that in practice manual searches are still the default.\\n\\nWe have developed a data platform in which the unstructured data is organized using machine learning / NLP and then stored together with the structured data from the EHR. The platform contains two innovative applications with which the EHR data can be searched and collected.\\n\\nOur aim has always been to support doctors in their work using data technology and it is with this in mind that we continue to develop and expand our platform. It goes without saying that privacy legislation forms a guideline in this. Our search engine is currently used daily in more than 40 hospitals in the Netherlands and Belgium. Our ambition is to expand the footprint of our platform to other key care and research hospitals across EMEA over the next few years.\\n\\nThose who join us become part of a recognized global leader still willing to challenge the status quo to improve patient care. In this business unit, you will have access to the most cutting-edge technology, the largest data sets, the best analytics tools and, in our opinion, some of the finest minds in the Healthcare industry.\\n\\nWe thank all applicants for their interest; however only those selected for interview will be contacted.\\n\\nIQVIA is a strong advocate of diversity and inclusion in the workplace. We believe that a work environment that embraces diversity will give us a competitive advantage in the global marketplace and enhance our success. We believe that an inclusive and respectful workplace culture fosters a sense of belonging among our employees, builds a stronger team, and allows individual employees the opportunity to maximize their personal potential\\n\\nIQVIA is a leading global provider of advanced analytics, technology solutions and clinical research services to the life sciences industry. We believe in pushing the boundaries of human science and data science to make the biggest impact possible – to help our customers create a healthier world.

They already form the basis of all state-of-the-art systems in computer vision and natural language processing across a wide range of tasks and have shown impressive few-shot learning abilities. Despite their impressive achievements, these huge models also come with critical downsides including information hallucination, misalignment with human values, lack of safety assurance, and unsustainable data and compute costs both for training and adaptation to downstream tasks.\\n\\nThe goal of this PhD project is to address (some of) the limitations of foundation models by studying, developing, and benchmarking new adaptive learning schemes throughout the foundation model lifecycle, covering pre-training, fine-tuning and deployment. Adaptability during... pre-training may be achieved by studying foundation models for new modalities e.g., 3D and video, synthetic multimodal data generation, by new self-supervised learning methods, and/or by inductive biased transformers and self-attention design. Adaptability during fine-tuning may focus on data/compute efficient model adaptations, injecting new abilities through prompting and adaptors, in-context learning, and/or chain of thought reasoning via external knowledge sources. Finally, adaptability during deployment may consider model perturbation and test-time adaptation learning tactics. For evaluation we will focus on a suite of downstream vision tasks that may include recognition challenges like object detection, image segmentation, action recognition, generation challenges like compression and super-resolution and miniaturization challenges like multimodal in-context learning and visual question answering.\\n\\nThe student will be supervised by Prof. dr. Cees Snoek, Professor at the University of Amsterdam, and Dr. Yuki Asano from the University of Amsterdam and Qualcomm. The position will be part of the QUVA Lab, which is an academic-industry lab supported by Qualcomm, and the ELLIS Network of Excellence in AI.\\n\\nWhat are you going to do?\\n\\nYou will carry out research and development in the areas of foundation models, deep machine learning and computer vision.

They already form the basis of all state-of-the-art systems in computer vision and natural language processing across a wide range of tasks and have shown impressive few-shot learning abilities. Despite their impressive achievements, these huge models also come with critical downsides including information hallucination, misalignment with human values, lack of safety assurance, and unsustainable data and compute costs both for training and adaptation to downstream tasks.\\n\\nThe goal of this PhD project is to address (some of) the limitations of foundation models by studying, developing, and benchmarking new adaptive learning schemes throughout the foundation model lifecycle, covering pre-training, fine-tuning and deployment. Adaptability during... pre-training may be achieved by studying foundation models for new modalities e.g., 3D and video, synthetic multimodal data generation, by new self-supervised learning methods, and/or by inductive biased transformers and self-attention design. Adaptability during fine-tuning may focus on data/compute efficient model adaptations, injecting new abilities through prompting and adaptors, in-context learning, and/or chain of thought reasoning via external knowledge sources. Finally, adaptability during deployment may consider model perturbation and test-time adaptation learning tactics. For evaluation we will focus on a suite of downstream vision tasks that may include recognition challenges like object detection, image segmentation, action recognition, generation challenges like compression and super-resolution and miniaturization challenges like multimodal in-context learning and visual question answering.\\n\\nThe student will be supervised by Prof. dr. Cees Snoek, Professor at the University of Amsterdam, and Dr. Yuki Asano from the University of Amsterdam and Qualcomm.

It has great potential to assist decision making in the real world with the power of AI and big data. Recent years have witnessed the flourishing of deep learning based methods in solving various COPs, where Deep Reinforcement Learning has been verified efficacious to deliver comparable or superior performance than some traditional optimization algorithms.However, most current research is performed for solving standard or simplified COPs.

It has great potential to assist decision making in the real world with the power of AI and big data. Recent years have witnessed the flourishing of deep learning based methods in solving various COPs, where Deep Reinforcement Learning has been verified efficacious to deliver comparable or superior performance than some traditional optimization algorithms.However, most current research is performed for solving standard or simplified COPs. There is still a clear gap to apply deep learning techniques in real-world optimization... problems that are much more complex or large-scale. Several key issues on deep models such as generalization, robustness, scalability, etc. should be investigated, before we can realize their applications in real life. To achieve the above goals, we are looking for one PhD student who will be oriented towards developing Deep Learning techniques for practical combinatorial optimization. This position will be based in the Information Systems (IS) Group and will be supervised by Yaoxin Wu and Yingqian Zhang.As a successful applicant, you will work in an international research team and specialize in the following potential research topics:\\n• Neural Solvers Design: proposing DRL methods to solve COPs such as routing problems, scheduling problems, integer programs.\\n• Omni-Reliable Neural Solver Development: proposing advanced techniques to enhance the performance of neural solver for COPs, in terms of generalization, robustness, scalability.\\n• Real-world optimization problems: testing the proposed methods in real-world COPs, including traveling salesman problems (TSPs), vehicle routing problems (VRPs), airport ground handling, train unit shunting, metro rescheduling, etc.\\nYou are expected to publish your research works in top-tier AI international conferences and journals.\\n\\nRequirements\\n• You have a Master's degree in Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence, Operations Research, Data Science, Industrial Engineering, or a similar field of study.\\n• You have a strong programming background, preferably in Python.\\n• You have a strong affinity with interdisciplinary research and enjoy collaborating with others.\\n• You can work on a challenging topic that has both fundamental and applied research aspects.\\n• Your communication skills are excellent as is your proficiency in English and your ability to collaborate in an international setting.\\n\\nContract terms\\nA meaningful job in a dynamic and ambitious university, in an interdisciplinary setting and within an international network. You will work on a beautiful, green campus within walking distance of the central train station.

The CHAMP project, awarded with a NGF AiNed Fellowship grant to Dr. Sonja de Zwarte, aims to develop and apply deep learning techniques to extract valuable information on early brain and social-emotional development from already acquired images and videos within the YOUth cohort study to predict mental health outcome in children.\\n\\nThe three PhD vacancies each have their own focus, but the PhD candidates will work closely together in an interdisciplinary team of AI-specialists, computer scientists, psychologists, neuroscientists and environmental epidemiologists on the CHAMP project, all supervised by Dr. Sonja de Zwarte.\\n• PhD1:\\n\\nYou will study early brain development based on analyzing 3D fetal ultrasound data. You will be... co-designing and improving deep learning methods for automatic and rapid segmentation of the brain in fetal 3D ultrasound. In particular, you will be involved in improving our current convolutional neural network to quantify fetal brain structures from 3D ultrasounds in the YOUth cohort, applying the neural network to independent populations and clinical data sets, exploring unsupervised transfer learning methods and exploring the added value of multimodality imaging by combining fetal MRI and ultrasound data. You will become part of an existing collaboration between Utrecht University and the Eindhoven University of Technology (TU/e). Professor Hilleke Hulshoff Pol (Experimental Psychology, Utrecht University) and Dr. Ruud van Sloun (Electrical Engineering, TU/e) will be the promotors of the PhD trajectory. You will have regular interaction with the Signal Processing Systems group at the Electrical Engineering department at the TU/e.\\n• PhD2:\\n\\nYou will study early social-emotional development based on analyzing parent-child interaction videos. You will be co-designing and improving deep learning methods for automatic and rapid classification of parent-child interaction videos available in the YOUth cohort to quantify emotional face expression and early motor developmental features in young children. You will build upon existing work on child behaviour analysis under different activities, as well as the estimation of child affect during natural interactions. In addition, self-supervised feature extraction with contrastive learning techniques, including contrastive predictive coding and SimCLR, will be explored. Ultimately, you will aim to integrate longitudinal measurements from video material to follow individual development of young children over time. Professor Jaap Denissen (Developmental Psychology, Utrecht University) and Professor Albert Salah (Information and Computing Sciences, Utrecht University) will be the promotors of the PhD trajectory. You will have regular interaction with the Social and Affective Computing group at the Department of Information and Computing Sciences.\\n• PhD3:\\n\\nYou will study environmental factors (i.e., exposome) impacting early childhood development. You will develop prediction machine learning models based on the available imaging data and investigate how the exposome influences early brain and social-emotional development. The exposome concept represents the sum of all environmental drivers of health and disease, and, together with recent technological advances, has the potential to identify environmental contributors to health and disease in a manner complementary to the genome. For characterizing the exposome, you will e.g., link spatio-temporal characterizations of the social, food and physico-chemical environments with mental health outcome in children. Unraveling which environmental factors have positive or adverse effects on the developing child will aid in the design of effective prevention strategies. Professor Hilleke Hulshoff Pol (Experimental Psychology, Utrecht University), Dr. Odilia Laceulle (Developmental Psychology, Utrecht University), and Dr. Ulrike Gehring (Institute for Risk Assessment Sciences, Utrecht University) will be the (co-)promotors of the PhD trajectory.\\n\\nYou will become skilled in developing hypotheses and analyzing large scale datasets, publishing in peer-reviewed scientific journals, and presenting your work at conferences. The position allows you to obtain an academic qualification (PhD). In addition, the CHAMP project offers opportunities to develop yourself in terms of interdisciplinary research, societal impact, outreach, and open science.\\n\\nYour work will also include a 10% teaching task, such as the supervision of Bachelor’s and Master’s theses. Of course, you will be guided and supported by your supervisors and colleagues.\\n\\nYou will work in a collaborative, social, and dedicated team.

The CHAMP project, awarded with a NGF AiNed Fellowship grant to Dr. Sonja de Zwarte, aims to develop and apply deep learning techniques to extract valuable information on early brain and social-emotional development from already acquired images and videos within the YOUth cohort study to predict mental health outcome in children.\\n\\nThe three PhD vacancies each have their own focus, but the PhD candidates will work closely together in an interdisciplinary team of AI-specialists, computer scientists, psychologists, neuroscientists and environmental epidemiologists on the CHAMP project, all supervised by Dr. Sonja de Zwarte.\\n• PhD1:\\n\\nYou will study early brain development based on analyzing 3D fetal ultrasound data. You will be... co-designing and improving deep learning methods for automatic and rapid segmentation of the brain in fetal 3D ultrasound. In particular, you will be involved in improving our current convolutional neural network to quantify fetal brain structures from 3D ultrasounds in the YOUth cohort, applying the neural network to independent populations and clinical data sets, exploring unsupervised transfer learning methods and exploring the added value of multimodality imaging by combining fetal MRI and ultrasound data. You will become part of an existing collaboration between Utrecht University and the Eindhoven University of Technology (TU/e). Professor Hilleke Hulshoff Pol (Experimental Psychology, Utrecht University) and Dr. Ruud van Sloun (Electrical Engineering, TU/e) will be the promotors of the PhD trajectory. You will have regular interaction with the Signal Processing Systems group at the Electrical Engineering department at the TU/e.\\n• PhD2:\\n\\nYou will study early social-emotional development based on analyzing parent-child interaction videos. You will be co-designing and improving deep learning methods for automatic and rapid classification of parent-child interaction videos available in the YOUth cohort to quantify emotional face expression and early motor developmental features in young children. You will build upon existing work on child behaviour analysis under different activities, as well as the estimation of child affect during natural interactions. In addition, self-supervised feature extraction with contrastive learning techniques, including contrastive predictive coding and SimCLR, will be explored. Ultimately, you will aim to integrate longitudinal measurements from video material to follow individual development of young children over time. Professor Jaap Denissen (Developmental Psychology, Utrecht University) and Professor Albert Salah (Information and Computing Sciences, Utrecht University) will be the promotors of the PhD trajectory. You will have regular interaction with the Social and Affective Computing group at the Department of Information and Computing Sciences.\\n• PhD3:\\n\\nYou will study environmental factors (i.e., exposome) impacting early childhood development. You will develop prediction machine learning models based on the available imaging data and investigate how the exposome influences early brain and social-emotional development. The exposome concept represents the sum of all environmental drivers of health and disease, and, together with recent technological advances, has the potential to identify environmental contributors to health and disease in a manner complementary to the genome. For characterizing the exposome, you will e.g., link spatio-temporal characterizations of the social, food and physico-chemical environments with mental health outcome in children. Unraveling which environmental factors have positive or adverse effects on the developing child will aid in the design of effective prevention strategies. Professor Hilleke Hulshoff Pol (Experimental Psychology, Utrecht University), Dr. Odilia Laceulle (Developmental Psychology, Utrecht University), and Dr. Ulrike Gehring (Institute for Risk Assessment Sciences, Utrecht University) will be the (co-)promotors of the PhD trajectory.\\n\\nYou will become skilled in developing hypotheses and analyzing large scale datasets, publishing in peer-reviewed scientific journals, and presenting your work at conferences. The position allows you to obtain an academic qualification (PhD). In addition, the CHAMP project offers opportunities to develop yourself in terms of interdisciplinary research, societal impact, outreach, and open science.\\n\\nYour work will also include a 10% teaching task, such as the supervision of Bachelor’s and Master’s theses. Of course, you will be guided and supported by your supervisors and colleagues.\\n\\nYou will work in a collaborative, social, and dedicated team. We will guide you in your research and teaching tasks, which will help you develop your academic career.

They already form the basis of all state-of-the-art systems in computer vision and natural language processing across a wide range of tasks and have shown impressive few-shot learning abilities. Despite their impressive achievements, these huge models also come with critical downsides including information hallucination, misalignment with human values, lack of safety assurance, and unsustainable data and compute costs both for training and adaptation to downstream tasks.\\n\\nThe goal of this PhD project is to address (some of) the limitations of foundation models by studying, developing, and benchmarking new adaptive learning schemes throughout the foundation model lifecycle, covering pre-training, fine-tuning and deployment. Adaptability during... pre-training may be achieved by studying foundation models for new modalities e.g., 3D and video, synthetic multimodal data generation, by new self-supervised learning methods, and/or by inductive biased transformers and self-attention design. Adaptability during fine-tuning may focus on data/compute efficient model adaptations, injecting new abilities through prompting and adaptors, in-context learning, and/or chain of thought reasoning via external knowledge sources. Finally, adaptability during deployment may consider model perturbation and test-time adaptation learning tactics. For evaluation we will focus on a suite of downstream vision tasks that may include recognition challenges like object detection, image segmentation, action recognition, generation challenges like compression and super-resolution and miniaturization challenges like multimodal in-context learning and visual question answering.\\n\\nThe student will be supervised by Prof. dr.

They already form the basis of all state-of-the-art systems in computer vision and natural language processing across a wide range of tasks and have shown impressive few-shot learning abilities. Despite their impressive achievements, these huge models also come with critical downsides including information hallucination, misalignment with human values, lack of safety assurance, and unsustainable data and compute costs both for training and adaptation to downstream tasks.\\n\\nThe goal of this PhD project is to address (some of) the limitations of foundation models by studying, developing, and benchmarking new adaptive learning schemes throughout the foundation model lifecycle, covering pre-training, fine-tuning and deployment. Adaptability during... pre-training may be achieved by studying foundation models for new modalities e.g., 3D and video, synthetic multimodal data generation, by new self-supervised learning methods, and/or by inductive biased transformers and self-attention design. Adaptability during fine-tuning may focus on data/compute efficient model adaptations, injecting new abilities through prompting and adaptors, in-context learning, and/or chain of thought reasoning via external knowledge sources. Finally, adaptability during deployment may consider model perturbation and test-time adaptation learning tactics. For evaluation we will focus on a suite of downstream vision tasks that may include recognition challenges like object detection, image segmentation, action recognition, generation challenges like compression and super-resolution and miniaturization challenges like multimodal in-context learning and visual question answering.\\n\\nThe student will be supervised by Prof. dr. Cees Snoek, Professor at the University of Amsterdam, and Dr. Yuki Asano from the University of Amsterdam and Qualcomm. The position will be part of the QUVA Lab, which is an academic-industry lab supported by Qualcomm, and the ELLIS Network of Excellence in AI.\\n\\nWhat are you going to do?\\n\\nYou will carry out research and development in the areas of foundation models, deep machine learning and computer vision.

{'title': 'PhD Operations Research & Artificial Intelligence for Sustainable...', 'company_name': 'TU Eindhoven', 'location': '  Eindhoven, Netherlands   ', 'via': 'via Jobbird', 'description': \"At TU/e, we solicit applications for PhD students in an industry-driven project. With our industry partner, we investigate more realistic, but also easily usable planning tools for mid-sized transport companies. At the core of all algorithms and planning tools stands the possible increase of sustainability, e.g., by reducing empty mileage and unused capacity.\\nProject description\\n\\nWith this project, we aim to develop planning solutions using both traditional methods from operations research and artificial intelligence. The developed tools will have the potential to make road transport both more efficient, more resilient, and more sustainable, and will also address driver shortages, ongoing electrification and automation of road transport, and collaboration and competition in the transportation market.\\n\\nDuring an early phase of the project, the students will jointly get to know the industry partner and the challenges of such medium-sized road transport companies. Further, the students... will become acquainted with the daily job of planners, and will perform some preliminary analyses. We will also use this time to break down the project into multiple smaller research projects.\\n\\nSome exemplary research projects include:\\n• Learning the planners’ decision-making process: We will use historic data on decisions (using inverse optimization) and/or experiments to elicit information about the planning process, such as informal soft constraints but also considered future events.\\n• Improving the interaction between planners and tools: In their day-to-day work, planners face a multitude of messages coming in (e.g., existing inefficiencies, new orders, or delays of loads requiring replanning) with different urgency and impact. Using experiments, we will investigate how different communication measures increase or decrease the planners efficiency.\\n• Developing next-day planning algorithms: Transport companies must coordinate not only their trucks, but also their loads and their drivers. All three are subject to a multitude of regulations (e.g., country-specific vehicle permits, driver rest time). We will develop algorithms for next-day planning using efficient algorithms such as branch-price-and-cut as well as heuristics.\\n• Developing dynamic planning algorithms: We will combine classic OR techniques with reinforcement learning methods to allow real-time planning of trucks, drivers, and loads.\\nTU/e and the team\\n\\nThe PhD students will be supervised by dr. Albert H. Schrotenboer, dr. Layla Martin, and prof. dr. Tom Van Woensel. Albert and Layla are both assistant professors with a clear focus on planning and operating transport and logistics, and Tom is a full professor for freight logistics.\\n\\nOur industry partner is an international logistics service provider employing more than 400 people headquartered in Utrecht (around one hour by car from TU/e, costs covered). They offer transport, flexible storage and logistics optimization, and act as a transporter (2PL), freight forwarder (3PL) and handle the complete management of logistics transport activities (4PL). Our industry partner strives to offer the best possible sustainable transport solutions based on honesty and respect for people and society.\\n\\nThe project, the supervisors, and eventually also the PhD students are embedded in TU/e’s Operations, Planning, Accounting, and Control (OPAC) group, the Eindhoven AI systems institute (EAISI) of TU/e, and the European Supply Chain Forum (ESCF). OPAC uses methods from operations research and operations management on a wide variety of problems, and currently hosts around 50 PhD students from various backgrounds. EAISI brings together all AI-related activities throughout TU/e and will support the PhD students by providing an enriching environment. ESCF works on fostering collaborations between industry and academia, among others in their program lines “ESCF Circular” and “AI planner for the future”.\\nTarget profile\\n\\nWe are looking for PhD students with a keen interest making transport more sustainable.

With our industry partner, we investigate more realistic, but also easily usable planning tools for mid-sized transport companies. At the core of all algorithms and planning tools stands the possible increase of sustainability, e.g., by reducing empty mileage and unused capacity.\\nProject description\\n\\nWith this project, we aim to develop planning solutions using both traditional methods from operations research and artificial intelligence. The developed tools will have the potential to make road transport both more efficient, more resilient, and more sustainable, and will also address driver shortages, ongoing electrification and automation of road transport, and collaboration and competition in the transportation market.\\n\\nDuring an early phase of the project, the students will jointly get to know the industry partner and the challenges of such medium-sized road transport companies. Further, the students... will become acquainted with the daily job of planners, and will perform some preliminary analyses. We will also use this time to break down the project into multiple smaller research projects.\\n\\nSome exemplary research projects include:\\n• Learning the planners’ decision-making process: We will use historic data on decisions (using inverse optimization) and/or experiments to elicit information about the planning process, such as informal soft constraints but also considered future events.\\n• Improving the interaction between planners and tools: In their day-to-day work, planners face a multitude of messages coming in (e.g., existing inefficiencies, new orders, or delays of loads requiring replanning) with different urgency and impact. Using experiments, we will investigate how different communication measures increase or decrease the planners efficiency.\\n• Developing next-day planning algorithms: Transport companies must coordinate not only their trucks, but also their loads and their drivers. All three are subject to a multitude of regulations (e.g., country-specific vehicle permits, driver rest time). We will develop algorithms for next-day planning using efficient algorithms such as branch-price-and-cut as well as heuristics.\\n• Developing dynamic planning algorithms: We will combine classic OR techniques with reinforcement learning methods to allow real-time planning of trucks, drivers, and loads.\\nTU/e and the team\\n\\nThe PhD students will be supervised by dr. Albert H. Schrotenboer, dr. Layla Martin, and prof. dr. Tom Van Woensel. Albert and Layla are both assistant professors with a clear focus on planning and operating transport and logistics, and Tom is a full professor for freight logistics.\\n\\nOur industry partner is an international logistics service provider employing more than 400 people headquartered in Utrecht (around one hour by car from TU/e, costs covered). They offer transport, flexible storage and logistics optimization, and act as a transporter (2PL), freight forwarder (3PL) and handle the complete management of logistics transport activities (4PL). Our industry partner strives to offer the best possible sustainable transport solutions based on honesty and respect for people and society.\\n\\nThe project, the supervisors, and eventually also the PhD students are embedded in TU/e’s Operations, Planning, Accounting, and Control (OPAC) group, the Eindhoven AI systems institute (EAISI) of TU/e, and the European Supply Chain Forum (ESCF). OPAC uses methods from operations research and operations management on a wide variety of problems, and currently hosts around 50 PhD students from various backgrounds. EAISI brings together all AI-related activities throughout TU/e and will support the PhD students by providing an enriching environment. ESCF works on fostering collaborations between industry and academia, among others in their program lines “ESCF Circular” and “AI planner for the future”.\\nTarget profile\\n\\nWe are looking for PhD students with a keen interest making transport more sustainable. Students shall have prior experience in optimization, operations research, decision support, and/or artificial intelligence, for example proven by a suitable master degree (e.g., Industrial Engineering, Econometrics, Applied Mathematics, Computer Science).

Using experiments, we will investigate how different communication measures increase or decrease the planners efficiency.\\n• Developing next-day planning algorithms: Transport companies must coordinate not only their trucks, but also their loads and their drivers. All three are subject to a multitude of regulations (e.g., country-specific vehicle permits, driver rest time). We will develop algorithms for next-day planning using efficient algorithms such as branch-price-and-cut as well as heuristics.\\n• Developing dynamic planning algorithms: We will combine classic OR techniques with reinforcement learning methods to allow real-time planning of trucks, drivers, and loads.\\n\\nTU/e and the team\\n\\nThe PhD students will be supervised by dr.

Their services focus on all aspects of the use of models:\\n• data\\n• model development\\n• validation\\n• policy and strategy\\n\\nWhile models form the core of their services, they perceive them as a means rather than an end. Statistics are no substitute for judgment – the decision makers must understand what a model can and cannot do.\\n\\nAim: to co-create and tailor a crucial and unique level of oversight and align the models with their client`s strategies.\\n\\nLocation:\\n\\nBased in central Amsterdam on one of the oldest canals that once formed the financial heart of the city.\\n\\nTeam:\\n\\nA team of 50 ambitious individuals with quantitative backgrounds in Econometrics, Mathematics, Physics, Data Analytics or...

The combination of their quantitative background, soft skills and “keep it simple” attitude sets them apart.\\n\\nTheir modest size enables them to work closely with their clients in solving complex challenges. It’s about connecting dots. Being an associative thinker, with the ability to remember conversations as well as numbers. Treat your clients as your (favorite) sparring partners but remember to talk about other things that matter - strategically, business proposals, even personal issues.\\n\\nInvolvement:\\n\\nTo optimally benefit from their skills, they actively involve senior consultants at any project.

This ever changing – and complex financial world demands robust risk management, equally robust models which will be the key to success.\\n\\nModels are an important instrument in this regard. Their services focus on all aspects of the use of models:\\n• data\\n• model development\\n• validation\\n• policy and strategy\\n\\nWhile models form the core of their services, they perceive them as a means rather than an end. Statistics are no substitute for judgment – the decision makers must understand what a model can and cannot do.\\n\\nAim: to co-create and tailor a crucial and unique level of oversight and align the models with their client`s strategies.\\n\\nLocation:\\n\\nBased in central Amsterdam on one of the oldest canals that once formed the financial heart of the city.\\n\\nTeam:\\n\\nA team of 50 ambitious individuals with quantitative backgrounds in Econometrics, Mathematics, Physics, Data Analytics or... Data Engineering. Valuing social interaction (doing fun stuff together) and an informal work environment with much individual freedom.\\n\\nTheir people are the primary reason for their success. Having quantitative backgrounds is key, but also focusing on communications and using a pragmatic approach to find keep-it-simple solutions. “Never go at it alone, involve our clients at each and every step…”\\n\\nFun:\\n\\nWorking hard is important, but they don’t take themselves too seriously. They enjoy what they`re doing and have fun when they can.\\n\\nIt is people that matter most;\\n\\nA close-knit team of craftsmen who are driven by what they do. The combination of their quantitative background, soft skills and “keep it simple” attitude sets them apart.\\n\\nTheir modest size enables them to work closely with their clients in solving complex challenges. It’s about connecting dots. Being an associative thinker, with the ability to remember conversations as well as numbers. Treat your clients as your (favorite) sparring partners but remember to talk about other things that matter - strategically, business proposals, even personal issues.\\n\\nInvolvement:\\n\\nTo optimally benefit from their skills, they actively involve senior consultants at any project.

They already form the basis of all state-of-the-art systems in computer vision and natural language processing across a wide range of tasks and have shown impressive few-shot learning abilities. Despite their impressive achievements, these huge models also come with critical downsides including information hallucination, misalignment with human values, lack of safety assurance, and unsustainable data and compute costs both for training and adaptation to downstream tasks.\\n\\nThe goal of this PhD project is to address (some of) the limitations of foundation models by studying, developing, and benchmarking new adaptive learning schemes throughout the foundation model lifecycle, covering pre-training, fine-tuning and deployment. Adaptability during... pre-training may be achieved by studying foundation models for new modalities e.g., 3D and video, synthetic multimodal data generation, by new self-supervised learning methods, and/or by inductive biased transformers and self-attention design. Adaptability during fine-tuning may focus on data/compute efficient model adaptations, injecting new abilities through prompting and adaptors, in-context learning, and/or chain of thought reasoning via external knowledge sources. Finally, adaptability during deployment may consider model perturbation and test-time adaptation learning tactics. For evaluation we will focus on a suite of downstream vision tasks that may include recognition challenges like object detection, image segmentation, action recognition, generation challenges like compression and super-resolution and miniaturization challenges like multimodal in-context learning and visual question answering.\\n\\nThe student will be supervised by Prof. dr. Cees Snoek, Professor at the University of Amsterdam, and Dr. Yuki Asano from the University of Amsterdam and Qualcomm.

They already form the basis of all state-of-the-art systems in computer vision and natural language processing across a wide range of tasks and have shown impressive few-shot learning abilities. Despite their impressive achievements, these huge models also come with critical downsides including information hallucination, misalignment with human values, lack of safety assurance, and unsustainable data and compute costs both for training and adaptation to downstream tasks.\\n\\nThe goal of this PhD project is to address (some of) the limitations of foundation models by studying, developing, and benchmarking new adaptive learning schemes throughout the foundation model lifecycle, covering pre-training, fine-tuning and deployment. Adaptability during... pre-training may be achieved by studying foundation models for new modalities e.g., 3D and video, synthetic multimodal data generation, by new self-supervised learning methods, and/or by inductive biased transformers and self-attention design. Adaptability during fine-tuning may focus on data/compute efficient model adaptations, injecting new abilities through prompting and adaptors, in-context learning, and/or chain of thought reasoning via external knowledge sources. Finally, adaptability during deployment may consider model perturbation and test-time adaptation learning tactics. For evaluation we will focus on a suite of downstream vision tasks that may include recognition challenges like object detection, image segmentation, action recognition, generation challenges like compression and super-resolution and miniaturization challenges like multimodal in-context learning and visual question answering.\\n\\nThe student will be supervised by Prof. dr. Cees Snoek, Professor at the University of Amsterdam, and Dr. Yuki Asano from the University of Amsterdam and Qualcomm.

Within the Knowledge Engine team, we... connect SmartHome-systems in the Horizon2020-project InterConnect, thereby balancing the local energy consumption (heating, electricity, vehicle chargers) and energy production (solar cells, wind energy, heating nets, home batteries).In the greenhouse domain, we apply symbolic AI solutions (knowledge representation & reasoning) to standardize the way data is collected and exchanged.

We focus on solutions that support humans in doing analyses and making decisions, more effectively and efficiently than human alone or data-driven solutions alone could do. For example, you can think of safety inspectors deciding about targeted actions in hazardous situations, of growers deciding how to optimize the circumstances in his greenhouse for more and more sustainable gain and of provincial policy officers deciding about which companies to invest in.In the Norm Engineering project, we develop formalizations of norms, to help organizations and individuals interpret laws and policies.Within industry, TNO works on trying to further the innovation and integration of Industry 4.0 in factories.
